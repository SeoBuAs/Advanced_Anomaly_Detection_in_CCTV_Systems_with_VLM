# Advanced_Anomaly_Detection_in_CCTV_Systems_with_VLM

### Abstract
The utilization of CCTV remains passive, and manually monitoring footage to witness crime scenes or track criminals' movements requires significant manpower and time, with the limitations of human attention potentially causing important situations to be overlooked. Therefore, we propose a deep learning-based smart CCTV solution that can somewhat mitigate these limitations.

### Dataset
